üìß Spam Mail Detection Project
üìå Overview

This project implements a Spam Mail Classifier using Machine Learning.
The classifier predicts whether an email message is:

üì© Ham (Not Spam)

üö´ Spam

This is a binary text classification problem widely used as a benchmark in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

üìÇ Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled emails/messages with two categories: ham and spam.

Preprocessing includes:

Removing stopwords & punctuation

Lowercasing text

Tokenization and lemmatization

Converting text to numerical features using Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF

‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Requirements

üöÄ Project Workflow

Data Loading ‚Äì Import dataset (CSV).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‚Äì Class distribution, word frequency, email length visualization.

Text Preprocessing ‚Äì Clean and prepare text for modeling.

Feature Extraction ‚Äì Convert emails into numerical features using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF.

Model Training ‚Äì Train multiple ML models:

Na√Øve Bayes

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluation ‚Äì Compare performance using:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix

üìä Results

Na√Øve Bayes with TF-IDF achieved the best performance with >95% accuracy.

Logistic Regression and SVM also performed well.

üñºÔ∏è Visualizations

Word clouds for spam vs ham

Distribution plots of message lengths

Confusion matrix for model performance

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook spammaildetection.ipynb


Or run as a Python script:

python spam_mail_detection.py

üîÆ Future Improvements

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

Use deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, Transformers)

Deploy as a Flask/Streamlit web app for real-time email filtering
